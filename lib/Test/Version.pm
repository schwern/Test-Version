=head1 NAME

Test::Version - Check to see that version's in modules are sane

=head1 VERSION

version 0.09

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Test::More;
	use Test::Version 0.04;

	# test blib or lib by default
	version_all_ok();

	done_testing;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module's goal is to be a one stop shop for checking to see that your
versions across your dist are sane. Please ensure that you use version C<0.04>
or later only, as earlier versions are old code and may not work correctly.
Current feature list:

=over

=item module has a version

Tests to insure that all modules checked have a VERSION defined, Can replace
L<Test::HasVersion>

=item module has a valid version

Tests to insure that all versions are valid, according to the rules of
L<version> method C<is_lax>. To quote:

I<The lax criteria corresponds to what is currently allowed by the version
parser. All of the following formats are acceptable for dotted-decimal formats
strings:>

	v1.2
	1.2345.6
	v1.23_4
	1.2345
	1.2345_01

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item C<version_ok( $filename, [ $name ] );>

Test a single C<.pm> file by passing a path to the function. Checks if the
module has a version, and that it is valid with C<is_lax>.

=item C<version_all_ok( [ $directory, [ $name ]] );>

Test all modules in a directory with C<version_ok>. By default it will check
C<blib> or C<lib> if you haven't passed it a directory.

=back

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

Will not test Perl 5.12 C<package> version declarations because
L<Module::Extract::VERSION> can't extract them yet.

=head1 SEE ALSO

The goal is to have the functionality of all of these.

=over

=item L<Test::HasVersion>

=item L<Test::ConsistentVersion>

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

C<Test::Version> and letting me maintain it further.
